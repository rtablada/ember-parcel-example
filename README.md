# Ember.js + Parcel.js Example

This application looks at what it takes to build a minimal [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) application with [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/).

The goal is to create a minimal Parcel plugin to build Ember applications in a modern way, while identifying headaches that come up when trying to use Ember.js as NPM packages.

## Branches

This experimentation takes a few stages.


* [`bare`](../../tree/bare) - Uses `ember-source` with no config or plugins
* [`templates`](../../tree/templates) - Uses `ember-source` with `babel-plugin-htmlbars-inline-precompile`
